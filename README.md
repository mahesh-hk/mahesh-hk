## 👋 Hi, I'm Mahesh
AI/ML Engineer | Aspiring Researcher | Embedded Systems Enthusiast | Data-Driven Problem Solver

I'm an AI/ML engineer and researcher with a strong foundation in systems programming, machine learning, and embedded control systems. My work bridges theory and practice—ranging from algorithm design and optimization to hands-on implementation across Python, C++, Java, and other technologies. I'm especially interested in intelligent systems that can reason, retrieve, and learn.

This GitHub serves as a space for documenting personal explorations, prototypes, and tools that complement my ongoing research interests.

Thanks for stopping by.

🧪 **Current Focus**:
- Researching semantic parsing for intelligent scientific retrieval
- Building ML systems in C++ (for learning and control)

📘 **Note**:
Most of my work is research-oriented or exploratory in nature and not ready for public release. What’s shared here are personal or fun side projects I use to learn, experiment, or explore new ideas.
